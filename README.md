# Capstone-Project1
Customers Churn Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
# Project Overview
the company faces the pressing need to address customer churn, which poses a significant threat to its business sustainability and growth.
They aim to develop a robust customer churn prediction system

## Project Objective
To build and train a robust machine learning model that can  accurately forecast customer churn and also to  implement targeted retention initiatives.

## Data source
The data source used in this project was provided by 10alytics

## Data Preprocessing
Extensive Data preprocessing was performed which involves handling missing data, scaling the data and normalization

## Machine Learning Model
The Machine Learning Models used were ;
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Gaussian
XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metrics used to determine the performance of the  models were;
Accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report

## Key insights
Given that problem statement for the Company is churn rate,  the most important metrics for evaluating model performance would be Recall and False Negatives.
Month-to-month contract customers have a higher churn rate compared to those with longer-term contracts. They can incentivize customers to switch to longer-term contracts by offering special discounts
Customers who subscribe to additional services such as online security, online backup, device protection, and tech support are less likely to churn. They can highlight the value of these services through targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations to encourage more customers to opt for these add-on features.
